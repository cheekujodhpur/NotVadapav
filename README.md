# Things You Can Do

## Sorting Images

1. Make a directory called `images`
2. Transfer all your images to this directory.
3. Go to this directory. `cd images`
4. Run `rename_all.sh` as `bash ../rename_all.sh ./ <format>`, where `<format>` is the current format of your images. This will rename all images as `image_XX.png` where `XX` is their index. It will create a copy of the image in `png` format. You may choose to manually remove the copies of the same image in the prior file format.
<font style="color:red">NOTE: This assumes all your files are in the same format to start with. If they are not, please prefer to do this entire Sorting procedure separately for each file format, while manually transferring one format into images at a time. </font>
5. Open `index.html` in a browser. 
6. Use arrow keys to move the crop box. 
7. Press
    - `q` to save as VADAPAV
    - `w` to save as NOT VADAPAV
    - `e` to save as BURGER OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO VADAPAV
    - `r` to simply reject the image and move on

8. The first time you try to save an image, you will get a dialog box which asks you to confirm the download. Mark _Do this automatically for files like this_ to remove the prompt and speeden your sorting process. Some manual work is required to specify the default Downloads directory as your preffered directory in your Browser Settings.
9. The process is over when no more images load in your browser.

In case of ambiguity, I assume you are smart enough to figure it out.
